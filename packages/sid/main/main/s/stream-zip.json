	"Description": [
		"Python function to construct a ZIP archive on the fly Python function to construct a ZIP archive on the fly - without having to store the entire ZIP in memory or disk. This is useful in memory-constrained environments, or when you would like to start returning compressed data before you've even retrieved all the uncompressed data. Generating ZIPs on-demand in a web server is a typical use case for stream-zip. . In addition to being memory efficient (with some limitations) stream-zip: . - Constructs ZIP files that can be stream unzipped, for example by stream-unzip - Can construct Zip64 ZIP files. Zip64 ZIP files allow sizes far beyond the approximate 4GiB limit of the original ZIP format - Can construct ZIP files that contain symbolic links - Can construct ZIP files that contain directories, including empty directories - Can construct password protected / AES-256 encrypted ZIP files adhering to the WinZip AE-2 specification - Allows the specification of permissions on the member files and directories (although not all clients respect them) - By default stores modification time as an extended timestamp. An extended timestamp is a more accurate timestamp than the original ZIP format allows - Provides an async interface (that uses threads under the hood)"
