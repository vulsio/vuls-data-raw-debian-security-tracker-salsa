	"Description": [
		"real-time audio resampling library A real-time library for audio sampling rate conversion providing several useful features relative to resample-1.7 on which it is based: * More portable (source includes autoconf script and Visual C++ project file, packaging adds CMake script with shared library support). * Memory-based (no need to read or write external files). * Floating-point computations (not fixed-point). * Faster and more accurate results (filter table increased by a factor of 32). * Supports variable resampling ratio (data can be processed in small chunks). * Easily applied to any number of simultaneous data channels * LGPL-licensed (libsamplerate, a GPL-licensed alternative, is considered by the libresample author to be technically superior)."
