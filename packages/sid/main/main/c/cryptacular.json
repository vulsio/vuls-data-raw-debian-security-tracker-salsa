	"Description": [
		"high level, general purpose Java cryptographic library General-purpose Java cryptograhic library, which complements the Bouncy Castle libraries, that has the following design goals: . * Flexible JCE provider. Prefers the Bouncy Castle Java Provider, but can fall back to other providers defined in the environment for algorithms not implemented by BC. * Ease of use for common cryptographic operations. A one liner highlights this well; the following prints the MD5 hash of a password as a string of HEX characters: System.out.println(new MD5().digest(passBytes, new HexConverter())); * Convenient and performant handling of cryptographic operations on large data streams. * Support for base-64 and hexadecimal encoding of ciphertext input/output. * Support for I/O operations on cryptographic primitives including generating and writing symmetric encryption keys, public/private key pairs, and X.509 certificates. Both PEM and DER encoding is handled conveniently. * Command line interface for each class of cryptographic operation (digest, symmetric encryption, public-key encryption, message signing, etc). A command line interface for keystore operations is also included, which is notable as it supports features above and beyond the Java keytool utility. . It is important to note that no cryptographic algorithms are implemented; Bouncy Castle provides all cryptographic algorithms where required."
