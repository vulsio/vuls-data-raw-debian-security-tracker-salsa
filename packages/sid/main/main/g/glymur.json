	"Description": [
		"Python tools for accessing JPEG2000 files Glymur is an interface to the OpenJPEG library which allows one to read and write JPEG 2000 files from Python. Glymur supports both reading and writing of JPEG 2000 images, but writing JPEG 2000 images is currently limited to images that can fit in memory. Glymur can read images using OpenJPEG library versions as far back as 1.3, but it is strongly recommended to use at least version 2.1.2. . In regards to metadata, most JP2 boxes are properly interpreted. Certain optional JP2 boxes can also be written, including XML boxes and XMP UUIDs. There is incomplete support for reading JPX metadata. . Glymur will look to use lxml when processing boxes with XML content, but can fall back upon the standard libraryâ€™s ElementTree if lxml is not available."
