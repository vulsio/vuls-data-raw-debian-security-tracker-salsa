	"Description": [
		"Python client for ECMWF web services API ECMWF WebAPI is a set of services developed by ECMWF to allow users from the outside to access some internal features and data of the centre. . This external access is limited and managed by the User Profile access (Member State, Commercial customers, ECMWF staff member...). Some of these services are public and some other are restricted to the Archive Access. . Anonymous access is the default type of access, with no configuration needed. However, anonymous access is only available for a limited set of datasets, and comes with a much lower quality of service. For access to all the available datasets, and an improved quality of service, the use of registered access is recommended."
