	"Description": [
		"Google's internal fork of OpenSSL for the Android SDK The Android SDK builds against a static version of BoringSSL, Google's internal fork of OpenSSL.  This package should never be used for anything but Android SDK packages that already depend on it. . BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Googleâ€™s product portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple places was growing steadily. . This is the Android AOSP fork of BoringSSL which is designed to be used by Android and its SDK.  BoringSSL is only ever statically linked into apps, and pinned to a commit version.  Upstream has no official releases of BoringSSL on its own, so it must be included separately for each project that uses it."
