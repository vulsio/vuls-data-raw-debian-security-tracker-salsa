	"Description": [
		"Encryption in the SQLite 3 database engine SQLCipher is a C library that implements an encryption in the SQLite 3 database engine.  Programs that link with the SQLCipher library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS process.  It allows one to have per-database or page-by-page encryption using AES-256 from OpenSSL. . SQLCipher has a small footprint and great performance so itâ€™s ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile development. . * as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption * 100% of data in the database file is encrypted * Uses good security practices (CBC mode, key derivation) * Zero-configuration and application level cryptography * Algorithms provided by the peer reviewed OpenSSL crypto library. . SQLCipher has broad platform support for with C/C++, Obj-C, QT, Win32/.NET/Mono, Java, Python, Ruby, Linux, Mac OS X, iPhone/iOS, Android, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android."
