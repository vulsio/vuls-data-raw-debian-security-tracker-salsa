	"Description": [
		"Rapid fuzzy string matching library RapidFuzz is a fast string matching library for Python and C++, providing Levenshtein and other distances.  This is similar to the functionality of the python3-fuzzywuzzy package.  There are a few significant differences between these packages: . 1) RapidFuzz is MIT licensed. 2) RapidFuzz provides many string metrics, such as Hamming and Jaro-Winkler, which are not included in FuzzyWuzzy. 3) RapidFuzz is mostly written in C++, and has further algorithmic improvements to make string matching even faster. 4) RapidFuzz fixes multiple bugs in the `partial_ratio` implementation."
