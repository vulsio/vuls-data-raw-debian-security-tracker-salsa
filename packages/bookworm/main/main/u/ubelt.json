	"Description": [
		"Python Utility Belt Library Ubelt is a small library of robust, tested, documented, and simple functions that extend the Python standard library. It has a flat API that all behaves similarly on Windows, Mac, and Linux (up to some small unavoidable differences). Almost every function in ubelt was written with a doctest. . * Goal: provide simple functions that accomplish common tasks not yet addressed by the python standard library. * Constraints: Must be low-impact pure python; it should be easy to install and use. * Method: All functions are written with docstrings and doctests to ensure that a baseline level of documentation and testing always exists (even if functions are copy/pasted into other libraries) * Motto: Good utilities lift all codes."
