	"Description": [
		"SQL linter tool SQLFluff is an extensible and modular linter designed to help you write good SQL and catch errors and bad SQL before it hits your database. . SQLFluff has a few components: . 1) A generic parser for SQL which aims to be able to unify SQL written in different dialects into a comparable format. Most of the codebase for SQLFluff is the parser, mostly because at the point of developing SQLFluff, there didnâ€™t appear to be a good option for a whitespace-aware parser that could be used instead. . 2) A mechanism for measuring written SQL against a set of rules, with the added ability to fix any violations found. The core vision for SQLFluff is to be really good at being the linter. . 3) An opinionated set of guidelines for how SQL should be structured and formatted. SQLFluff aims to be opinionated but it also accepts that many organisations and groups have pre-existing strong conventions around how to write SQL and so ultimately SQLFluff should be flexible enough to support whichever rule set a user wishes to. . 4) A public API for other Python applications to use SQLFluff to check and fix SQL code in an automated fashion."
